Blood City... A dank, dirty city, filled with
murderists and cultists... This is the last place
you wanted to end up.

You are Blood City's best and only Bone Merchant.
Human bones, animal bones, Dark bones, whatever
you can get your hands on.

Your recent haul came from a nameless grave outside
of the city. The skull has a real strange shape,
you've never seen anything like it.

But when you look at the bones, you can't help but
feel a strange presence about them... Something dark,
creepy as shit. You swear you can see some sort of
figure around them deep in the night. It's been keeping you up at night.

You need to get rid of them as fast as possible.
Bones are illegal in Blood City, but there are 
people who'll buy them. You're not supposed to 
meet your client for a few days, but I think it's
time to get rid of these bones now, don't you?

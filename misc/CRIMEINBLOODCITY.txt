CARD DESCRIPTIONS

------------------------------------------------

BONES - Bones are kind of taboo in Blood City. Selling them can be tricky. 
These bones are very high quality, and well worth a BUCK. You can't help but feel a strange presence
around them though. The sooner you get rid, the better.

KNIFE - KNIVES ARE DANGEROUS BUT BLOOD IS COOL, I'M DEEPLY CONFLICTED

MURDER LOVER - A message left written in blood. Courier New, 20 pt. You think this might
be the name of the murderer.

SPOOKBOY - Seems to be a friend of SLUGBOY's. They were going to meet up
at the graveyard, but then he died.

SLUGBOY - You knew him only as SLUGBOY, through a bone exchange website. He was stabbed
in the chest and died from a stab in the chest. 

====================================================


PART ONE - FINDING THE BODY

START - OFFICE

[MAP: YOUR OFFICE]

OBJECTS - COMPUTER, BAG OF BONES, DOOR TO 'WORLD MAP'

Short intro plays out, then player assumes control.

BAG OF BONES - It's a bunch of high quality bones you recently acquired.
You had to go out of town to get these, but you found the perfect spot:
a nameless grave in the middle of nowhere. Bones aren't exactly appreciated
here in Bone City, mind you. Still, these bones make you feel uncomfortable,
they have a strange feeling about them. Like an extra shadow, or an aura.
Pretty creepy.
[GET BONES CARD]

COMPUTER - There's an e-mail on screen. 
"Damn, nice bones. Real nice. A guy could have a good time 
with those bones. In exchange for the bones, I'll give you
the bucks. Bring them round to my place in a few days. 
I'm at 233 BLOOD STREET. It's the block of apartments by the
SAD HOUSE.

- Slugboy"

HALLWAY

OBJECTS - OPEN DOOR, CLOSED DOOR, DOOR TO WORLD MAP

--- BEFORE SEEING DEAD BODY ---
CLOSED DOOR - You knock on the door, and a man appears.
He stares at you with an almost murderous grin, his skull-like head raised slightly, 
as if he were staring down inside of you. It makes you feel fucked up.

"Hmm..."

BONEs CARD (if taken earlier) - "Bones? I don't want anything to do with bones, buddy. This is Blood City, bones are useless!! Bones are piss!!" 
NO CARD - Leave

--- AFTER SEEING DEAD BODY ---

CLOSED DOOR - You knock on the door, and a man appears.
He stares at you with an almost murderous grin, his skull-like head raised slightly, 
as if he were staring down deep inside of you. It makes you feel fucked up.
He notices your hand trembling about the same time you do. You only just realised, but the
shock of seeing blood has kind of messed you up. He sees this, and his eyes widen. Could he 
tell?

BONES CARD (if taken earlier) - "Bones? I don't want anything to do with bones, buddy. This is Blood City, bones are useless!! Bones are piss!!" 

KNIFE CARD - "Knives? The only thing I know about knives is they make the blood come out. Why would I know anything about knives? What are you suggesting, buddy?"

SLUGBOY CARD - The bulges of flesh around his face seem to collapse into the middle, as a deep frown forms.
"I've got nothing to say about those two creeps."

MURDER LOVER CARD - "Hmm... I don't get it. Blood lover, sure, everyone loves blood... But murder seems
a little too much to me..."

SPOOKBOY CARD - The smirk on the man's face fades into a more concerned look. He seems a little unsettled.
"There's something wrong with that kid... Both of them... Always hanging out that Cemetary down the road...
If I didn't know better, I'd say they were really into bones. And that is a pretty dangerous thing to be
fascinated by in Blood City..." [MAP: CEMETARY]

SLUGBOY'S APARTMENT

OBJECTS - 
ROOM 1
COMPUTER, BOOKCASE
ROOM 2
BLOODY BED, KNIFE, DEAD BODY, TORN PICTURE

COMPUTER - The screen is filled with DUNGBOOK, a website designed for sharing dung with friends. 
There's a message from a person named SPOOKBOY, and though it feels wrong to read it, it is important to remember
there is no such thing as privacy on DUNGBOOK.

"Meet me tonight. Same time, same grave. Prepare to get spooked.

- Spookboy"

Sounds spooky... 

[ADD SPOOKBOY CARD]

BOOKCASE - There are a number of books here on magic and occultism. A few about human anatomy,
and some Angela Carter short stories.

---

BLOODY BED - The mattress is stained a deep red. The pool of blood looks fresh but has started to sink into
the fabric. It looks like someone was here bleeding for a while, until they got dragged off.

KNIFE - This is a sharp knife, plunged into the wall with some force. It'd take some strength to pull it
out. The long blade is coated with a thin layer of blood.  On the wall is a message...
"MURDER LOVER". The message is written in blood... There is so much blood here... [GET KNIFE CARD] [GET MURDER LOVER CARD]

TORN PICTURE - There's a large, framed picture of your client, Slugboy. The picture is torn in half,
but it seems like there should be another person here.

DEAD BODY [FIRST TIME] - Your heart sinks as you see the slumped heap of flesh-coloured blood lying on the floor.
It is without a doubt your client, you recognise his face from the "Post Your Skull" thread on the
bone exchange website. Looking closer, you can see a lot of blood flowing from a fatal stab wound
to the chest. Judging from the size of the pool of blood, you figure he's been slumped here for a while,
but the trail of blood leading from the bed suggests he was moved after being stabbed.

Your immediate reaction is to run away, but you have nowhere to run. You've no doubt left traces
around the place, and the cops would come to you sooner or later. For a moment you contemplate going
to the cops, but the last time you did you got thrown in jail. Seems like the Blood Cops have a bone
to pick with you. 

So your solution is simple: find the murderer, and take them to the cops. For now, Slugboy is going to 
have to stay collapsed on the floor. [GET SLUGBOY CARD] 


DEAD BODY [AFTER FIRST] - Slugboy is still here. Still dead. The blood is no longer pouring from his chest,
but it is still a pretty shocking sight. Hopefully nobody wanders in and sees this...

----------------------------------------

[SAD HOUSE]

Sad House is a little aside. It's a room with sad people talking about how sad they are in Blood City.
Will finish this last as it's not too important.
